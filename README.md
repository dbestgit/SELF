# SELF
Sustainable Energy and Localized Futures - An initiative in GIS based energy system option planning and visualization

THE SELF Github repository provides spatial and statistical data that may be applied by individuals, communities, researchers and policy makers to assist in the measurement, assessment and evaluation of options for social, ecological and energy systems planning.

This data and code can be run with a basic open source GIS system like QGIS and is designed to enable local practitioners and stakeholders to have an informed process of options when considering responses to surveys, informal community engagement and formal decisionmaking processes.

The application of this data and information can be considered as an initial platform to engage, explore and document options for adaptive community assessment. The SELF project and repository is also coupled with a network of other project under the SAM-I-AM platform.
